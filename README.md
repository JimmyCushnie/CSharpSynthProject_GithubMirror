# CSharpSynthProject Github Mirror

This is a github mirror of [CSharpSynthProject](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=csharpsynthproject), to ease viewing and cloning the code.

I have been working on a total overhaul of this library for my game [Logic World](https://logicworld.net/). This overhaul is called LogicSynth and it will be released when it is done, hopefully later this year.
